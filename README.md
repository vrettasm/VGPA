# VGPA

**Variational Gaussian Process Approximation**

This project contains a python3 implementation of the original VGPA
algorithm for approximate inference in SDEs. It can be directly applied
to solve (perform inference) to four (stochastic) dynamical systems,
namely:

1. [Double Well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-well_potential)
2. [Ornstein-Uhlenbeck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornstein%E2%80%93Uhlenbeck_process)
3. [Lorenz63 (3D)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system)
4. [Lorenz96](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_96_model)

For any other dynamical system, one has to write the required code
(and inherit from the stochastic_process.py) to generate the sample
paths and compute the required energy terms.

The forward-backward ODEs can be solved with four different solvers:

1. [Euler's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method) 1st order
2. [Heun's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heun%27s_method) 1st order (predictor-corrector)
3. [Runge-Kutta 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods) 2nd order
4. [Runge-Kutta 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods) 4th order

The implementation is independent from third-party libraries since all the
optimization (SCG) and integration routines (Fwd/Bwd) are custom made.
However, we need to have installed numpy, scipy, numbda, etc.
